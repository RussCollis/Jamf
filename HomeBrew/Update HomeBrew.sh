Homebrew Update and Upgrade Script
=============================================================================
Description:   Jamf Policy Script that updates Homebrew repository and 
               upgrades all installed packages and casks. Automatically 
               switches to console user context when running as root to 
               comply with Homebrew security requirements.
Author:        Unknown
Created:       
Version:       1.0
Requirements:  Homebrew installed on target systems, sufficient disk space
               for upgrades, network connectivity, admin privileges for some
               cask upgrades
Output:        Comprehensive logging of update process, success/failure status
IMPORTANT:     This script is specifically designed for KPMG's macOS
               environment and should only be deployed within KPMG's managed
               infrastructure. It contains organisation-specific
               configurations and should not be used outside of this intended
               environment.
